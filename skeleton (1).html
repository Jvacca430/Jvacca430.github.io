				<p> Hello, my name is Jamie Vacca and I am a Sophomore at the University of Wisconsin- Madison with a major in Journalism. Iâ€™m from Weston, Connecticut, and went to Weston High School. Throughout my time at UW thus far, I have become an active member in several organizations. One of my favorite organizations I am involved with is The Fit Magazine. I write articles for The Fit. I am also the Vice President of Recruitment for my sorority, Sigma Delta Tau. Through both of these organizations as well as others, I have made a concerted effort to be an active member of the Madison community.</p>
